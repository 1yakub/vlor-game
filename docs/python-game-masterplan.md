# VarygenCorp Game - Python Implementation Plan

## Technical Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Game Engine**: Pygame (for 2D graphics and game loop)
- **Networking**: Python-socketio (for real-time multiplayer communication)
- **Server**: FastAPI (for game server and REST endpoints)
- **Database**: SQLite (for development) / PostgreSQL (for production)
- **IDE**: Cursor (for enhanced AI-assisted development)

### Key Libraries
```python
requirements = {
    "pygame": "2.5.0",          # Game engine
    "python-socketio": "5.8.0", # Multiplayer networking
    "fastapi": "0.100.0",       # Server framework
    "sqlalchemy": "2.0.0",      # Database ORM
    "pytest": "7.4.0",          # Testing
    "black": "23.3.0",          # Code formatting
    "python-dotenv": "1.0.0",   # Environment management
    "pydantic": "2.0.0",        # Data validation
}
```

### Development Environment
- **IDE**: Cursor (primary development environment)
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Code Quality**:
  - Black (formatting)
  - Pylint (linting)
  - MyPy (type checking)
- **Testing**: Pytest with coverage

## Game Architecture

### Client-Side Components
1. **Game Window & Graphics**
   - 2D top-down view
   - Sprite-based characters
   - Tilemap-based office environment
   - UI overlays for business/trading interfaces

2. **Player Controls**
   - Keyboard movement (arrow keys/WASD)
   - Mouse interaction for UI elements
   - Context-sensitive actions (Space/E key)

3. **Client Features**
   - Local player movement prediction
   - Asset management (sprites, sounds)
   - UI rendering
   - Input handling
   - Network state management

### Server-Side Components
1. **Game State Management**
   - Player positions and states
   - Business data and transactions
   - Conflict tracking
   - Resource management
   - Role assignments (mafia system)

2. **Networking Features**
   - Player synchronization
   - Real-time updates
   - Room management
   - State reconciliation

3. **Game Logic**
   - Business mechanics
   - Conflict resolution system
   - Economy management
   - Role-based permissions

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Game Setup (2-3 weeks)
- Set up Pygame environment
- Create basic window and player movement
- Implement basic map rendering
- Set up basic client-server communication

### Phase 2: Multiplayer Foundation (3-4 weeks)
- Room system implementation
- Player synchronization
- Basic collision detection
- Chat system

### Phase 3: Core Game Systems (4-5 weeks)
- Business mechanics
- Resource management
- Trading system
- Basic UI implementation

### Phase 4: Special Features (4-5 weeks)
- Conflict resolution system
- Mafia mechanics
- Role-based abilities
- Advanced UI elements

### Phase 5: Polish and Testing (2-3 weeks)
- Bug fixing
- Performance optimization
- Game balance
- User testing

## Implementation Details

### Networking Flow
1. Client connects to server via Socket.IO
2. Server assigns room and initial state
3. Real-time updates using event-based communication
4. State synchronization every X milliseconds

### Game State Management
1. Server as source of truth
2. Client-side prediction for smooth movement
3. Regular state reconciliation
4. Optimistic UI updates with rollback capability

## Getting Started Guide

1. Install Python 3.8+ and required packages:
```bash
pip install pygame python-socketio fastapi uvicorn arcade sqlalchemy
```

2. Set up development environment:
```bash
git clone [repository]
cd varygen_corp
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the server:
```bash
python server/main.py
```

4. Run the client:
```bash
python client/main.py
```

## Next Steps
1. Set up basic Pygame window and player movement
2. Implement basic server-client communication
3. Create simple room system
4. Add basic player synchronization
5. Implement map rendering
