# Varygen: Lords of Resolution (V:LoR)
## Cursor-Optimized Development Roadmap

### Phase 0: Project Setup (Days 1-2)
- Initialize Python virtual environment
- Set up Git repository
- Configure development environment:
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Create initial project structure:
  ```
  vlor/
  ├── src/
  │   ├── client/
  │   │   ├── game.py
  │   │   ├── player.py
  │   │   └── ui/
  │   ├── server/
  │   │   ├── app.py
  │   │   └── game_state.py
  │   └── shared/
  │       └── constants.py
  ├── assets/
  │   ├── sprites/
  │   ├── maps/
  │   └── sounds/
  ├── tests/
  ├── requirements.txt
  └── README.md
  ```

## Development Guidelines

### Using Cursor AI Effectively
1. Use AI for:
   - Code generation
   - Bug fixing
   - Documentation
   - Test creation
   - Refactoring suggestions

2. Development Flow:
   - Write clear requirements
   - Let AI suggest implementation
   - Review and modify suggestions
   - Test thoroughly
   - Commit working code

### Code Quality Standards
```python
# Example of well-documented code
class Player:
    """Represents a player in the game world.
    
    Attributes:
        position (Vector2): Current position in the game world
        role (Role): Player's current role (Mediator/Business/Mafia)
        inventory (Inventory): Player's inventory
    """
    def __init__(self, player_id: str, name: str):
        self.id = player_id
        self.name = name
        self.position = pygame.math.Vector2(0, 0)
        self.role = None
        self.inventory = Inventory()
```

### Testing Strategy
```python
# Example test case
def test_player_movement():
    """Test player movement mechanics."""
    player = Player("test_id", "Test Player")
    initial_pos = player.position.copy()
    
    # Test movement
    player.move(Direction.RIGHT)
    assert player.position.x > initial_pos.x
    
    # Test collision
    player.position = Vector2(0, 0)
    wall = Wall(Vector2(32, 0))
    assert not player.can_move(Direction.RIGHT, [wall])
```

### Daily Development Cycle
1. Morning:
   - Review previous day's work
   - Plan day's objectives
   - Update documentation

2. Development:
   - Write tests first
   - Implement features
   - Use Cursor AI for assistance
   - Regular commits

3. End of Day:
   - Run all tests
   - Update development log
   - Plan next day's tasks

## Progress Tracking

Keep a daily development log in `docs/dev-log.md`:
```markdown
# Development Log

## Week 1, Day 1
- [x] Set up project structure
- [x] Installed dependencies
- [x] Created basic window

## Week 1, Day 2
- [x] Implemented game loop
- [x] Added basic player movement
...
```

Would you like me to:
1. Explain any part of this development plan in more detail?
2. Help you set up the initial project structure?
3. Start working on a specific week's implementation?
4. Create more detailed documentation for any particular system?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed with the development process.
